# ReconScan

This is an enumeration tool built from https://github.com/xapax/oscp/blob/master/recon_enum/reconscan.py. Currently updating but it does work mostly. xapax had a few bugs I am working out. I even added a proper install script to create the neccessary files. Everything is built in /root/oscp.
